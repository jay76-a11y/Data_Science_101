#   ISIC 2024 CHALLENGE
ISIC 2024 Challenge is a competition in Kaggle which asks the participant to develop image-based algorithms to identify histologically confirmed skin cancer cases with single-lesion crops from 3D total body photos (TBP). The image quality resembles close-up smartphone photos, which are regularly submitted for telehealth purposes.

##  Basic Idea
Instead of completing the challenge by combining the prediction of image based model (typically CNN to classify pictures), I'm using a tree based model instead since it is proved by many papers that tree based model will always outperform NN based model on tabular data, and for this case I choose XGB as the base model and googlenet
